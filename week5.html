  <h1>Robinson Crusoe – Building a Raft</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    In this part of the story, Crusoe stops waiting and decides to take action.
    He builds a raft from ship materials so he can carry supplies to shore.
  </p>

  <h2>Why He Builds the Raft</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>He realizes sitting and hoping will not help.</li>
    <li>He needs food, tools, and weapons to survive.</li>
    <li>The raft is the only way to move heavy items safely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Materials He Uses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Large wooden spars and spare yards</li>
    <li>Planks and boards for the surface</li>
    <li>A spare topmast cut into pieces</li>
    <li>Ropes to tie everything together</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What He Loads First</h2>

  <h3>Food</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bread and rice</li>
    <li>Dutch cheese</li>
    <li>Dried goat meat</li>
    <li>Grain (later ruined by rats)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Carpenter’s chest</li>
    <li>Saws, hammer, and axe</li>
    <li>He values tools more than gold</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Weapons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Two guns and two pistols</li>
    <li>Powder and shot</li>
    <li>Old swords</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges on the Sea</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The raft almost tips when it hits shallow water.</li>
    <li>He must hold the chests to stop them from falling.</li>
    <li>He waits for the tide to rise before moving again.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why He Succeeds</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The sea is calm.</li>
    <li>The tide moves toward land.</li>
    <li>A small wind helps guide the raft.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Decision</h2>
  <p>
    Crusoe chooses to stay close to the coast. He hopes he might see a ship one day,
    but for now his priority is survival and preparation.
